# Automatic-Rumor-Prediction-on-Twitter
This is a group project for my course work in Introduction to Data Science at UMD. please visit https://absolutelysanchari.wixsite.com/automaticrumorpredic for reports and class presenations which I and my group did.


#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project aims to build a model to predict whether tweets are rumors or not, predicting gender of users spreading rumor tweets and also predicting topics of those rumors and thereby indicating the accuracy of these predictions.
Information available on social networking websites like Twitter and Facebook has a global outreach, underlying the crucial role played by social media in modern day communication. With the increasing number of active users on social media, the need for accurate and unbiased information is vital. Rumors are easily spread through such websites, impacting people and organizations across the world. While social media is great platform to broadcast news, rumors create a void in the availability of credible information. We attempt to fill this void by developing a system that can catch such rumors, and also validate other cases that are genuine.
